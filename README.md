# Mastering Python

This repository was created to accompany the book "Learning Python" ISBN: 978-1-78355-171-2.

This guide will closely follow the book and be broken in to smaller parts as needed. In some places the code may be "fixed", completed, or altered to better represent a complete picture of the code.

This is merely a resource for aiding in helping beginners get started with programming in Python 3.
